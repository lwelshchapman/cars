# Cars.sh

This repo contains a bash script named “cars.sh” that will help a user maintain an inventory of old cars.
 
 The user will be presented with a menu of three options:
 1. Enter a new car.
 2. Display the list of cars.
 3. Quit the program.

## Entering a New Car
The user will be asked for the year, make, and model of the car.
This info will be appended to "My\_old\_cars".


## Displaying the List of Cars
The contents of "My\_old\_cars" will be printed to the console.
Each car entry will be sorted by year using the "sort" command.

## Quitting the Program
The program terminates.
Changes to "My\_old\_cars" will persist after quitting.
